              <p class="item_text"> Asides from my research/CS life, I am a classically trained pianist and a composer. I began learning piano at the age of 5. I hold both a <a href="https://www.rcmusic.com/learning/examinations/recognizing-achievement/arct-lrcm"> Associate Diploma (ARCT) and a Licentiate Diploma (LRCM)</a> in Piano Performance, which are the highest academic standings awarded by the Royal Conservatory of Music Certificate Program. I have performed as a soloist, chamber musician, accompanist, and in various music ensembles. I participated in and won in many different categories in solo piano competitions under <a href="https://omfa.ca">OMFA</a>. </p>
                
              <p class="item_text">I also double concentrated in music with honors at Brown University, where I was fortunate to have had piano instructors, Saleem Abboud Ashkar and Rosalind Chua, and was also part of a piano trio, coached by Consuelo Sherba, and did my honors project on composing a symphony advised by Anthony Cheung (and read by Mark Seto). </p> 
                
              <p class="item_text">I began dabbling in composition back in middle school for the UTS Twig Tape and have composed for a variety of small and large ensembles. I also briefly learned violin in my string classes in middle and high school, and have also played violin (less frequently) in string ensembles and for score reading in conducting classes. </p>
              
              <p class="item_text"> Another music fun fact about me is that I played percussion (drum kit and aux percussion) for a few years! </p>

                          <p style="color:cornflowerblue;line-height: 20px;">"Odyssey"</p>
                          <p class="item_text"> Composed by Rachel Ma in 2022-2023 for music honors thesis. Read by the Brown University Orchestra.</p>
                          <p class="item_text">For my senior honors thesis, I presented a score for a 9.5 minute symphonic composition titled “Odyssey”. This piece is inspired by my memories and emotions that I have experienced during my undergraduate years at Brown University, with expansions from themes that were present in my previous composition, Recollections. Through working on this thesis, I took the time to create a larger scale piece, and experiment with the instrumentation and music styles, to better tell a connected story of growth and emotions through composition. The piece consists of four movements, each representing a year at Brown. The piece aims to portray the different feelings and experiences such as adapting, companionship, happiness, comfort, loneliness, challenges, and growth since high school. Various music styles such as jazz and serialism are incorporated.</p>
