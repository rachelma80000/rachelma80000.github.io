              <p class="item_text"> Space for any blog posts I eventually make. I took a couple of Lit classes at Brown University during Undergrad for fun (Fiction and Creative Non-Fiction classes). My writing typically incorporates feelings of nostalgia, and I like to write about my memories.</p>

                            "I Remember" was written for my Creative Non-Fiction class in Spring 2023, referencing some of my memories around music.

                            “Constant” was written for the modular design assignment in my Fiction Class (Spring 2022). This was a challenging yet fun assignment with trying to write sections that had no particular order. I decided to tackle this challenge by having a similary form for every section: a sentence that starts with “It just occurred to me that the Ratty …”, then followed by three short sentences of thought, followed by more explanation. Why the Ratty? I spend some amount of time there every day, sometimes on my own, sometime with others. It’s a constant in most of my days here at Brown, so there’s a strong sense of familiarity with it, and sometimes I do get bored of it. But there’s also new memories generated with old and new friends, the nice feeling of having something stable in a wonky day, and some subtle things that I didn’t notice until writing this piece.

                            "Contemplation" (Spring 2022) introduces why I commonly have feelings of nostalgia and why memories are important to me. There is also the inclusion of autobiographical material, with memories from my past and details about myself. The inspiration for the original piece was based on a photo that I took on a trip with friends during Spring Break.

                            <p class="item_text">
                            “Code” (Spring 2022) is a writing piece that plays with the form of code and the Python coding language. As a computer science concentrator and robotics researcher, a bulk of my thoughts include trying to represent computations and daily tasks with limited syntax with code. This piece is an attempt to define myself and referencing autobiographical details through the other functions for implementing my complicated daily schedule and in my attempts to code how memories are generated and stored.
